First follow the installation steps described previously.

== Install demo tables
In APEX, navigate to SQL Workshop > Utilities > Sample Datasets.

Install `HR Data`.
This will install several tables and views, each prefixed by `OEHR_`. We will be basing the example on table `OEHR_EMPLOYEES`.

To make it a little more interesting, we'll add a multi-line Notes field:

----
alter table OEHR_EMPLOYEES add
notes varchar2(2000);
----

== Create the audit trigger

Navigate to SQL Workshop > SQL Commands.

. On the lower half of the screen, select *Saved SQL*.
. Click on *Create Audit Trigger* and click on Run. A prompt appears for the table name
. Enter `OEHR_EMPLOYEES` and click on Submit.

To view the generated trigger:

. navigate to SQL Workshop > Object Browser
. Click on table `OEHR_EMPLOYEES`
. Click on *Triggers* (on the right)
. Click on trigger `TRG_AUD_OEHR_EMPLOYEES`
. Click on *Code*

== Create the view

[source,sql]
----
include::oehr_employees_vw.sql[]
----

== Create Page

=== Create standard Page

In your application:

. select the *Create Page* button
. Choose Form > Report with Form. Click Next.
. Fill out *Report Page name* and **Form Page Name**. Click Next.
. Create a new navigation menu entry
. Datasource: Select table `OEHR_EMPLOYEES`. Click Next.
. Create Form: Select `EMPLOYEE_ID` as the primary key. Press Create.

Let's add LOVs to the 3 foreign keys. Set the Type to `Select List` and List of Values Type as SQL Query with the following SQL:

*JOB_ID*
----
select job_title as display_value
, job_id as return_value
from oehr_jobs
order by 1
----

*MANAGER_ID*
----
select email as display_value
, employee_id as return_value
from oehr_employees
order by 1
----

*DEPARTMENT_ID*
----
select department_name as display_value
, department_id as return_value
from oehr_departments
order by 1
----

We now have the regular Report and Form. We'll now add a region with the audit information.

=== Add Interactive Report
